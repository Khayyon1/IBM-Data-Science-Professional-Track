# What is Data Science?
This is the first course in the IBM Data Science Professional Track. In this course I learned the following:

### Key Points
* Defining Data Science, what is it?
* What makes someone a Data Scientist
* Topics in Data Science
* Data Science in Business
* Along with the Report Structure for Data Science Projects

This course is a mix of video lectures and quizzes.

# Report Structure
   ## How big is the document ?
   Before starting the analysis think about the structure of the report. Will it be 5 pages or less, or will it be a longer document running for 100 pages? The structure of the report will vary based on the length. Why is this the case? A short document will be concise and present a summary of the key findings. A longer document will be a more detailed report that slowly builds the argument and contains information about other relevant works, research methodology, data sources, and intermediate findings along with the main results. The length of the document will vary based on it purpose: 
   * Smaller documents were typically drafted as commentaries on current trends and developments that attracted public and media attention
   * Larger documents offered a critical review of the subject matter with extensive data analysis and commentary. The detailed reports collected new data or interviewed industry experts to answer the research questions.
   
   ## The recommended structure of the report
   It is recommended that the deliverable follow a format including the following:
   * Cover Page
   * Table of Contents
   * Executive Summary
   * Detailed Contents
   * Acknowledgements
   * References
   * Appendices if needed
   
   ### Cover Page
   It should include the title of the report, name of the author(s), their affliations, and contacts, name of institutional publisher if available and date of the publication.

   ### Table of Contents (ToC)
   The ToC with main headings and list of tables and figures offers a glimpse of what lies ahead in the document. Please include tis page especially if the document in 5 or more pages in length.

   ### Executive Summary
   The <em>abstract</em> or <em>executive summary</em> is recommended for all documents. There is nothing more helpful than a concise explaination of the core arguments for the document. This section can range from a few paragraphs to a few pages depending on the length of the document.

   ### Introductory Section
   helps to set up the problem being explored to the reader who might need an introduction to the subject matter being discussed.
   ### Methodology Section
   research methods and data sources used for the analysis are introduced here. If you collected new data then explain the data collection effort.

   ### Results section
   where the findings of the project are presented. Starting with descriptive statistics and graphics . Then discuss formally testing the hypothesis. This could include statisitical models (i.e regression models) or categorical analysis and etc.

   ### Discussion Section
   craft your main argument by building on the previously presented results. This is where the power of narrative is needed to communicate your thesis to the readers. 

   ### Conclusion Section
   generalize the findinfs and take on a rather marketing approach to promote your findings so that the reader does not remain stuck in the caveats that you outlined earlier. You might show future possible developments in research and applications that could result from the research.

   ## Data Science Deliverable Checklist
   1. Have you told readers, at the outset, what they might gain by reading your paper? 
   2. Have you made the aim of your work clear?
   3. Have you explained the significance of your contribution?
   4. Have you set your work in the appropriate context by giving sifficient background (including a complete set of relevant references) to your work?
   5. Have you addressed the question of practicality and usefulness?
   6. Have you discussed future developments that might result from the research
   7. Have you structured your paper in a clear and logical fashiion?
