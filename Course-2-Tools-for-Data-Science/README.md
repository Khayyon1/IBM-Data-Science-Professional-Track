# Tools for Data Science by IBM

<hr>
This is the second course in the IBM Data Science Professional Track. In this course I learned the following:

## Key Points
* Overview of Data Science tooling
* Tasks a data scientist needs to perform
* Top open source and commercial tools used for each task
* How the tools overlap in functionality
* Pros and cons of each tool
* How tools can address the whole data science pipeline

This course is a mix of video lectures, demonstrations, hands-on Labs and quizzes.
