# Tools for Data Science by IBM

<hr>
This is the second course in the IBM Data Science Professional Track. In this course I learned the following:

## Key Points
* Overview of Data Science tooling
* Tasks a data scientist needs to perform
* Top open source and commercial tools used for each task
* How the tools overlap in functionality
* Pros and cons of each tool
* How tools can address the whole data science pipeline

This course is a mix of video lectures, demonstrations, hands-on Labs and quizzes.

# Week 1
## Languages of Data Science
The languages they focused on introducing was Python, R and SQL along with a slew of other languages

## Data Science Tools
Discussed open sources tools versus commercial tools and cloud based tools as well

## Packages, APIs, Data Sets and Models
Discussed common libraries like NumPy, Scikit-learn Pandas, Matplotlib andd etc. Discussed ML models, Data Sets and introduced me to the Data Asset Exchange IBM Watson.
# Week 2
## Jupyter Notebook and JupyterLab
Basic introduction into the Jupyter Notebook environment. Discussing Kernels, Architecture and the basic features in Jupyter Notebook
## RStudio IDE
Plotting in RStudio, installing packages and etc
## GitHub

# Week 3
## Watson Studio and Other IBM Tools
It discusses IBM Watson Studio, signing up for the service and creating a Jupyter Notebook in Watson Studio. The Knowledge Catalog, Data Refinery, Modeler Flows (Visual Modeling via Watson Studio), Auto AI and etc.
# Week 4
## Create and Share your Jupyter Notebook on IBM Watson Studio

In this course, I had to make a notebook using the IBM Watson Studio. I will leave that to the reader to go and discover at their convience. But I also had to make the notebook viewable to the public to I will leave a link to the notebook [here.](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/analytics/notebooks/v2/798158d0-9985-4ac4-b6e0-9713a1fddffc/view?access_token=0ebb929227875a30e38c9edbeee2dd4184d46f40064c5a797577815d6b44fee7)
